# EpicGhoul--Cataclysm-4.3
World of Warcraft addon designed for Cataclysm (4.3.4)
Announces when you summon a Death Knight ghoul in an epic way!!
 
One of the Unholy DK's in my raid group kept editing a macro with the new name of his ghoul over the course of a raid night to something along the lines of "Rise corpseravager son of bladespinner son of bonechewer..." It was funny after we wiped on Neferian for a while and the macro got pretty long.

I thought making an addon that does this automatically could be a fun way to have a wipe counter of sorts while raiding.
